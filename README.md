# FindMinimumNumber
In this project, I used a deep neural network to find the minimum value in a list of numbers. In theory, a deep neural network should be able to find any relationships between inputs so in this project, I trained a DNN to learn Minimum function.  
The accuracy of the model, after 40 epochs training is 99.3.
